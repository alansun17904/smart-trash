abstract = {The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. To simplify the process, we propose an intelligent waste material classification system, which is developed by using the 50-layer residual net pre-train (ResNet-50) Convolutional Neural Network model which is a machine learning tool and serves as the extractor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, and plastic etc. The proposed system is tested on the trash image dataset which was developed by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and is able to achieve an accuracy of 87{\%} on the dataset. The separation process of the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.},

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the 'Squeeze-and-Excitation' (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251{\%}, achieving a {\~{}}25{\%} relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

To build this system, trash classification from trash images is an important issue in computer vision to be addressed for integrating into sensors. Therefore, this study proposes a robust model using deep neural networks to classify trash automatically which can be applied in smart waste sorter machines. Firstly, we collect the VN-trash dataset that consists of 5904 images belonging to three different classes including Organic, Inorganic and Medical wastes from Vietnam. Next, this study develops a deep neural network model for trash classification named DNN-TC which is an improvement of ResNext model to improve the predictive performance. Finally, the experiments are conducted to compare the performances of DNN-TC and the state-of-the-art methods for trash classification on VN-trash dataset as well as Trashnet dataset to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that DNN-TC yields 94{\%} and 98{\%} in terms of accuracy for Trashnet and VN-trash datasets respectively and thus it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for trash classification on both experimental datasets.},

abstract = {Smart Bins have become popular in smart cities and campuses around the world. These bins have a compaction mechanism that increases the bins' capacity as well as automated real-time collection notifications. In this paper, we propose WasteNet, a waste classification model based on convolutional neural networks that can be deployed on a low power device at the edge of the network, such as a Jetson Nano. The problem of segregating waste is a big challenge for many countries around the world. Automated waste classification at the edge allows for fast intelligent decisions in smart bins without needing access to the cloud. Waste is classified into six categories: paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic and other. Our model achieves a 97$\backslash${\%} prediction accuracy on the test dataset. This level of classification accuracy will help to alleviate some common smart bin problems, such as recycling contamination, where different types of waste become mixed with recycling waste causing the bin to be contaminated. It also makes the bins more user friendly as citizens do not have to worry about disposing their rubbish in the correct bin as the smart bin will be able to make the decision for them.},

The SSD (Single-Shot MultiBox Detector) MobileNet CNN architecture is used for classifying the solid and liquid spill debris on the floor through the captured image. Then, the SVM model is employed for binary classification of liquid spillage regions based on size, which helps floor-cleaning devices to identify the larger liquid spillage debris regions, considered as hard-to-clean debris in this work. The experimental results prove that the proposed technique can efficiently detect and classify the debris on the floor and achieves 95.5{\%} percent classification accuracy. The cascaded approach takes approximately 71 milliseconds for the entire process of debris detection and classification, which implies that the proposed technique is suitable for deploying in real-time selective floor-cleaning applications.},

abstract = {Garbage still has economic value if used correctly. Waste management from waste sources is an effective way to increase the selling value of waste and reduce waste that dumb into landfills. Waste recycling can provide economic benefits for the community. However, the price of waste or used goods is very dependent on the conditions and conditions of the world market. The percentage of the population Banda Aceh who often do recycle by 5.08\%, quite often 3.35\%, while those that are rare and never is 24.57\% and 67\% respectively. In this paper, we argue that recycling of used goods will provide economic benefits to the urban community if done well. These include waste separation and avoidance, community recycling centers and the provision of incentives and disincentives. This paper is to examine how the economic benefits obtained by the urban community if the implementation of Zero Waste principles is implemented in Banda Aceh. Research method based on surveys, in-depth interviews with various experts from academics and officers from the government, waste activists, and documents reviews.

@article{Jain2017,
abstract = {Non-Biodegradable substances produce the greenhouse gasses, methane and carbon dioxide. Growing plants and trees on top of a landfill, a process known as ‘Phyto capping’, could reduce the production  and  release  of  these gasses.  In  certain  parts  of  the world,it  remains  the  most  economical  and  simplest  method  of waste disposal. Biodegradation of organic matter in a landfill site occurs  most  rapidly  when  water  comes  into  contact  with  the buried  waste. An  important  step  in  the  drive  is  to  remove environmentally  harmful  materials  from  waste  streams  and drinking water. A synthetic clay known as swelling mica has the ability to separate ions of radium, a radioactive metal, from the water.  The  finding  could  have  implications  for  radioactive  and hazardous  waste  disposal,  particularly  in  the  cleanup  of  mill tailings left over from the processing of uranium for the nation’s nuclear industry. The tailings contain radium and heavy metals.

@article{Luo2019,
abstract = {The volume of solid waste has increased significantly in the past century, directly contributing to global environmental problems. Public engagement with waste sorting is crucial to the diversion of solid waste from landfill and the reduction of contamination in waste streams. The current study aims to promote recycling and
composting accuracy via a digital sorting game that provides immediate feedback. In this game, participants
manually sorted items into four bins (food scraps, recyclable container, paper, and garbage) via a computer
interface, and received immediate feedback on their performance after each trial. We found that immediate
feedback improved sorting accuracy as measured by correct key presses (Experiment 1) or motion trajectory
(Replication 1), even when feedback was no longer provided. This improvement in sorting accuracy remained a
week after playing the game (Replication 2). We then implemented this game in residences, and found that after
residents played this game, the weight of compost materials increased while the contamination rate decreased
(Experiment 2). These findings suggest that providing immediate feedback in a digital sorting game can be an
effective tool to engage and educate the public to increase recycling and composting rates.

@article{Abkenari2015,
abstract = {There have recently been many studies and investments in developed and developing countries regarding the possibility of recycling construction waste, which are still ongoing. Since the term 'construction waste' covers a vast spectrum of materials in constructing buildings, roads and etc., many investigations are required to measure their technical performance in use as well as their time and place of use. Concrete is among the major and fundamental materials used in current construction industry. Along with the rise of population in developing countries, it is desperately required to meet the people's primary need in construction industry and on the other hand, dispose existing wastes for reducing the amount of environmental pollutants. Restrictions of natural resources and environmental pollution are the most important problems encountered by civil engineers. Reusing construction waste is an important and economic approach that not only assists the preservation of environment but also, provides us with primary raw materials. In line with consistent municipal development in disposal and reuse of construction waste, several approaches including, management of construction waste and materials, materials recycling and innovation and new inventions in materials have been predicted. This article has accordingly attempted to study the activities related to recycling of construction wastes and then, stated the economic, quantitative, qualitative and environmental results obtained.
